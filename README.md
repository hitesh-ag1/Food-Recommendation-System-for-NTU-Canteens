# Food-Recommendation-System-for-NTU-Canteens
This is a food recommendation system for all the canteens inside NTU written in Python.
The main program file that will start this system is main.py. All other Python files are linked to this main file. All the images which are used for the UI of this system is stored in the images folder. The database of the food available in the canteens can be updated by changing the excel sheet named as Canteen. Many Python libraries are used including pandas, PyQt, pygame, etc. If any bug is found, feel free to post it as an issue.
